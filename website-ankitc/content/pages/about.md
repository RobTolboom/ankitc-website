title: About the Anaesthesia Network for Kidney Transplantation in Children

## Background
Pediatric kidney transplantations are performed in relative low numbers, even in expertise centers. Despite the high perioperative risk profile of both patient and procedure, international guidelines for anesthesia and ICU care are lacking. Furthermore, local guidelines show inconsistence, particularly in hemodynamic monitoring, -targets and -support ([Voet M, Cornelissen EAM Perioperative anesthesia care for the pediatric patient undergoing a kidney transplantation: An educational review. Paediatric anaesthesia. 2021;31(11):1150-60](https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.14271)). 

## Mission
This workgroup aims to improve perioperative care in paediatric kidney transplantation.

## Roadmap
* Organize a network for European anaesthesiologists and ICU doctors taking care of paediatric patients during kidney transplantation.
* Gather knowledge and experience of the network participants by means of the survey “Perioperative anesthesia and ICU practice in pediatric kidney transplantation in European expertise centers; an international survey”.
* Analyse the data from the survey and publish the results.
* Use the results as a discussion base for the development of a consensus guideline. Development of a consensus guideline using the Delphi method.
* Build a database for paediatric kidney transplantations focussing on anaesthesia and ICU related topics like; hemodynamic data and -support, ventilatory data and support, fluid therapy, postoperative outcome measures and complications. Explore possibility to extend the existent databases for paediatric kidney transplantation by ESPN.

## Support
This initiative collaborates with the European Reference Network (ERN), European Society for Paediatric Anaesthesiology (ESPA) and European Society for Paediatric Nephrology.
