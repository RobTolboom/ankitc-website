   abstract = {Living-donor kidney transplantation is the first choice therapy for children with end-stage renal disease and shows good long-term outcome. Etiology of renal failure, co-morbidities, and hemodynamic effects, due to donor-recipient size mismatch, differs significantly from those in adult patients. Despite the complexities related to both patient and surgery, there is a lack of evidence-based anesthesia guidelines for pediatric kidney transplantation. This educational review summarizes the pathophysiological changes to consider and suggests recommendations for perioperative anesthesia care, based on recent research papers.},
